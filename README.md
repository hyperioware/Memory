Just took an easy classic game to start working on -- I've always been curious about gaming concepts.

1. Yes, the cards are numbers, not pics :)
2. The scoring is level-based. The higher the level, the higher the multiplier.
3. It takes gaining XP to gain levels. The higher the levels, the more XP.
4. Level 5 is the cap. You can gain more XP, but there are no more levels.
5. Amount of XP after each round is determined by the percentage of turns unused based on the level and then multiplied by
the level's multiplier.
6. 2 bonuses available at the moment.
